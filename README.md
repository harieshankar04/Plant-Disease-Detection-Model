# ðŸŒ¿ Crop Disease Detection and Management System

A deep learning-powered system for the early detection and classification of crop diseases from leaf images. This project implements a high-performance inference pipeline designed for real-time alerts, enabling proactive crop management and minimizing yield loss.

## ðŸ“œ Overview

This project addresses the critical challenge of timely crop disease identification. By leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning models, it provides a fast and accurate method to detect diseases from images, simulating a smart camera sensor system. The core of the project is a highly efficient inference workflow (TensorFlow â†’ ONNX â†’ FastAPI) that delivers predictions with sub-300ms latency, making it suitable for real-time field applications.

The system is designed to reduce disease spread, cut costs associated with manual inspection, and provide early warnings for timely intervention, ultimately contributing to more sustainable agriculture.
